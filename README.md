# R Shiny Learning Repository

This repository serves as a learning hub for building interactive web applications using R Shiny. As I progress in my R Shiny journey, I will be creating and adding Shiny apps to this repository, showcasing various features, concepts, and improvements.

## App: 01

This Shiny app is a basic example with a navbar and input fields to capture first and last names, showcasing how to render the concatenated full name as an output.

## App: 03

This Shiny application serves as a tutorial showcasing the effective use of Shiny modules. By utilizing modular programming, we've organized the app into independent, reusable components, enhancing code maintainability and reusability.
